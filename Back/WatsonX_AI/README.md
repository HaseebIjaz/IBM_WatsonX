# Modularized WatsonX AI Project Assistant prototype.

## Overview

These files form a modular and manageable structure for the WatsonX AI Project Assistant prototype. This structure separates concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the application as needed.

## To run this prototype:

1. **Install the required dependencies:**: 
pip install streamlit langchain ibm-watson pyyaml

2. **Set Up**: 
Set up your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your WatsonX credentials.

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
